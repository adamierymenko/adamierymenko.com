# Trigger Warning: The Web is Eating the Desktop

*[Adam Ierymenko](index.html) | December 13th, 2017*

The last five applications I installed are [Electron](https://electronjs.org) apps. Nearly everything new I see for desktop is an Electron app. The most popular programmers' text editors today are Electron apps. We just picked the Electron/PWA approach for an upcoming project at [ZeroTier](https://www.zerotier.com/) after evaluating several alternatives.

I'm calling it.

In ten years nearly every desktop app that isn't over ten years old will be a progressive web app or a containerized (e.g. Electron) web app. The desktop UI itself may be rendered and managed as a web UI and if not it will just be an interface for managing containerized web UIs. Desktop computers will be more or less a fusion of a web browser with a server backend allowing web apps to run locally for performance, offline use, or privacy.

Legacy desktop UIs like the Windows and MacOS GUI interfaces will be supported but only for legacy apps. Almost nobody will develop new apps for them.

I actually called it in 2014 in a (badly titled and somewhat badly written) rant entitled *The Boat Linux Missed and How it Can Swim*. In this I argued the narrower case that Linux should embrace the web UI as its desktop UI of choice.

I thought it made sense. Web UIs are maturing, and the web is the world's largest and most active open source development community. As history since 2014 is showing it did make sense, but I wasn't prepared for what happend after I clicked the *publish* button.

## Trigger Warning!

I took the post offline after about a week because I received among other things DDOS attacks and frothing at the mouth e-mails including one sent from a throwaway e-mail that actually made threats of physical violence against myself and my family.

No, I am not making this up. I was as surprised and incredulous as you probably are now.

If you doubt the reality of these kinds of Internet rage-gasms just search for information about "GamerGate," a similarly bizarre over-reaction to a woman who dared criticize a video game... or something. Actually I'm not really sure what "GamerGate" was about or why anyone cared, but a lot of people did to such an extent that they completely lost their sanity over it.

When someone over-reacts emotionally to this degree we say that they've been "triggered." GamerGate clearly triggered people for reasons that I don't fully understand. Given the similarity of the online lynching I received, my post on web UIs for Linux clearly did as well. I could speculate on why but I have better things to do, and I'm sure that would just trigger people more anyway.

So be warned. This may trigger you. If you find yourself hyperventilating and contemplating the purchase of firearms, please just close the f'ing browser tab and go read something else. I realize that [someone being wrong on the Internet](https://www.xkcd.com/386/) is serious business but really?

## The Rant

Normally I don't do the "I was right haha!" thing, but given the insanity of the initial reaction I got in 2014 I just can't resist.

I was right.

Without further delay, here it is in PDF format:

[The Boat Linux Missed, and How It Can Swim](files/linux_web_desktop_rant.pdf)

It's a PDF because I yanked it out of the Internet Archive and am too lazy to reformat it. Here is the [original Web Archive link](https://web.archive.org/web/20140907024951/http://adamierymenko.com/the-boat-linux-missed/) if you prefer.

Enjoy, and if you still disagree in the age where everything new is an Electron app please maintain some sense of perpsective. You are entitled to your opinion and I am entitled to mine.
