This screenshot shows a simulation where random genesis has occurred. In random
genesis, a condition called GenesisCondition introduces cells with completely
random genomes into the world. Eventually, one of these will be able to
successfully copy it's genome out through the reproduction port, in which case
reproduction occurs. When this happens, the result is an explosion of cells
dissipating the energy in the universe. (This screenshot is from a much older
version of the software.)

<td class="description_td" bgcolor="#dddddd"><font face="verdana,arial" size="2">
Archis has been very helpful during it's development; to a certain extent,
it debugs itself. This screenshot shows a colony of cells that have figured
out how to exploit a bug in Landscape2D. They are somehow cooperating to
obtain an unlimited supply of energy by exploiting this bug. The bug turned
out to be that when cells transferred energy the original amount of energy
was not deducted from the transferring cell in all cases, but this was not
obvious here and required a detailed review of the code. These sorts of
exploits typically evolve very quickly when they are possible. Note how few
generations this one took to evolve! If left to itself, a colony exploiting
a bug like this will use up all the computer's memory very quickly. If we
invented a perpetual motion machine, we would probably fill the entire volume
of the universe in a very short amount of time too! It's a good argument as
to why perpetual motion and overunity devices are impossible: if life found
such a free energy source, the entire universe would be filled relatively
quickly with overunity-exploiting grey goo. :) (This screenshot is also
from an old version.)
