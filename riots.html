# Riots in the Streets

*[Adam Ierymenko](index.html) | August 29th, 2018*

If this is the Information Age and the Internet is the "information superhighway," what does a riot in the street look like?

We've all seen riots in previous ages. There are people chanting, maybe some throwing bricks or Molotov cocktails, clouds of tear gas, cops with shields and riot gear. There's shouting, people carrying signs, rubber bullets flying.

Today nobody goes outside. Everyone is glued to their phones. Have people stopped protesting? Have they stopped rioting?
